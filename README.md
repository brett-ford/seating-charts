## Seats 

This project automates the process of creating a new seating chart. 

My classroom has four tables. Every week or two, I like to change the students' seats so that they have an opportunity to 
work with, and learn from, new people. 

This code reads my students' names from my gradebooks, stored in Google Sheets files; makes a new seating chart; and 
stores the seating chart in a separate Google sheet, which I use to display the new seats.
