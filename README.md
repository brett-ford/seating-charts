## Seats 

This project automates the process of creating a new seating chart. 

My classroom has four tables. I like to change the students' seats weekly so that, over the course of the school year, 
they have an opportunity to work with everyone and experience the dynamics of many combinations of people working 
together. 

This app reads my students' names from my gradebooks, which are stored in Google Sheets files; reads the existing 
seating charts; creates a new seating charts for the periods requested; updates the existing seating chart, and writes 
the seating chart in a separate Google Sheet file, which I use to display the new seats to the students 
each week. The app also records the new seating chart in a json file. (See sample.json, a file that shows the storage
format with names of well-known people in place of my students' names.)
